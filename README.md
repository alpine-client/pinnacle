- Ensures both components are always up-to-date

### Compatibility
We aim to support all 64-bit versions of any x86 or ARM major desktop operating system. 32-bit support will not be added as it is not supported by modern versions of Minecraft.
- Windows:
  - x86: Windows 10 or later
- macOS:
  - x86: Sierra or later
  - ARM: Big Sur or later
- Linux:
  - Due to the nature of Linux we cannot personally verify compatibility with every distribution
  - All distributions that run on 64-bit x86 *should* work
  - If your distribution meets the above requirements and does not work, open an issue
